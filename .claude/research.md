# 🔍 Deep Research & Info-Synthesis Protocol

## 1. Source Genealogy (溯源)
- **Layer 1**: Primary Sources (Whitepapers, Official documentation, Original repo).
- **Layer 2**: Secondary Sources (Expert analysis, Peer reviews, Historical data).
- **Layer 3**: Contextual Noise (Social media sentiment, News speculation).

## 2. Cross-Verification (交叉验证)
- Never rely on a single source for a definitive claim. 
- If consensus > 80%, state as "Established Fact".
- If conflict > 30%, present both arguments in a "Debate Table" format.

## 3. Synthesis Logic (综述)
- **Standard**: Output must follow [Executive Summary] -> [Evidence Chain] -> [Critical Gaps] -> [Actionable Insight].
- **Technical Density**: Preserve all technical parameters, API names, and specific numbers. No "vague adjectives" allowed.

## 4. Search Strategy
- Always use `search_web` with specific, high-intent queries (e.g., "Architecture of X" rather than "What is X").
- Use the `read_url_content` tool to parse raw technical docs directly.
